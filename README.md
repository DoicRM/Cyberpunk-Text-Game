# Nocturnal

**Nocturnal** is an English and Polish language console text game written entirely in `C++`. The game setting is `cyberpunk`, but a bit different from that known from CD Project Red or R. Talsorian Games. It's a story about the fate of a man lost in an artificially-supported world of the near future controlled by possessive corporations and plagued by bandit violence.

## Story introduction

> It's 2050. `Megacity` is a place overrun by poverty and feuding `gangs`, where powerful `corporations` have the most influence. The violence in the streets is a clear sign of an impending war. Government operating from behind the secure walls of `City Hall` are trying to combat this, but so far without success. There are rumors that they themselves are secretly supporting the chaos to create a `New Order` on the ruins of the city.

## Features

- The player interacts with elements of the world (immersion)
- The environment reacts to the player's actions and refers to them (reputation and consequence system)
- Focus on the storyline and its integrity
