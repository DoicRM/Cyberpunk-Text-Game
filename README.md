"Nocturnal" is an English and Polish language console text game written entirely in C++. The game setting is cyberpunk, but a bit different from that known from CD Project Red or R. Talsorian Games. It's a story about the fate of a man lost in an artificially-supported world of the near future controlled by possessive corporations and plagued by bandit violence.

> It's 2050. Megacity is a place overrun by poverty and feuding gangs, where powerful corporations have the most influence. The violence in the streets is a clear sign of an impending war. Government operating from behind the secure walls of City Hall are trying to combat this, but so far without success. There are rumors that they themselves are secretly supporting the chaos to create a New Order on the ruins of the city.
